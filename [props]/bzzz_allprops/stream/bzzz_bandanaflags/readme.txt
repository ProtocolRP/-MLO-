Installation:
1) Insert folder "bzzz_bandanaflags" to resources folder
2) Add to server.cfg
3) Restart server

You have to spawn the flags.
You can use CodeWalker to create a ymap.
Props are just decorative. They have no collisions.
No need to use textures larger than 256x256. Most of the time you can't see the difference.
Use texture sizes: 4x4, 16x16, 32x32, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512... or 32x64, 256x128 etc.


If you stream props in another resource, you must edit the fxmanifest.
Add this line:
data_file 'DLC_ITYP_REQUEST' 'stream/bzzz_bandana_flags.ytyp'
