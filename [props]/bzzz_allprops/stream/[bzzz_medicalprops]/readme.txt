Hi,
thank you for your purchase.
Please don't release my work any longer.

Installation:
1) Insert folder "bzzz_medicalprops" to resources folder
2) Add to server.cfg
3) Restart server



If you stream props in another resource, you must edit the fxmanifest.
Add this line:
data_file 'DLC_ITYP_REQUEST' 'stream/bzzz_medicalprops_pack.ytyp'

Then the server must be restarted. 
YTYP loads properties of props.
Flag of the prop is set to 32 (static). You can change the properties in the YTYP.
